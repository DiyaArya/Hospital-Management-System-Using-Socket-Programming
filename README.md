The Python scripts create a secure communication system leveraging the TCP protocol for reliable data transmission between doctors and clients. The `server4.py` script efficiently manages network connections, doctor availability, and client sessions using TCP sockets combined with SSL for enhanced security. The `doctor4.py` script allows doctors to register and interact in real-time with clients, incorporating features for managing communication flow, including the ability to end conversations smoothly. The `client5.py` script ensures clients can securely connect and communicate with the server, employing SSL over TCP to guarantee encryption and integrity of the data exchanged. This setup exemplifies the use of advanced networking concepts, multithreading, and secure communication protocols in Python, providing a robust framework for handling sensitive interactions.
